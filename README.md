# Ensembled-ML-Approach-for-detecting-DDOS-Attacks
This project focuses on enhancing Network Security in a Software Defined Networking (SDN) environment through the detection of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Built on a simulation stack using Mininet, Ryu controller, and custom traffic generators.
